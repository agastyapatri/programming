# **This Project tracks my study of Data Structures and Algorithms in C++**
_While Python is the de facto standard while solving problems, I find myself tempted to resort to the built in methods that abstract away the minutiae of problem solving. Ergo, C++ it is._

This repository focuses on two things: 

1. Implementing key Data Structures in python and C++. This will be done without the help of any built-in tools.
2. Implementing key Algorithms to deal with problems
3. Identifying the features of a problem that call for a particular Data Structure / Algorithm

The purpose of this enterprise is self edification.
